## Project Description

The Twitter Clone starts a local FastAPI web server and renders HTML pages using Jinja2 templates. It connects to a SQLite database called `twitter_clone.db` and displays messages joined with user information.

The homepage shows a feed of messages ordered from newest to oldest.

The app also uses cookies to remember whether a user is logged in.
